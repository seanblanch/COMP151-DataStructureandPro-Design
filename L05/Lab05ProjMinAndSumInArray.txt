TESTING TO SEE IF IT CATCHES BAD ARGUMENTS
Trying a null array
    Passed test
Trying an array of size 0
    Passed test
Trying from less than 0
    Passed test
Trying to greater than size
    Passed test
Trying from > to
    Passed test


TESTING TO SEE IF IT GETS THE CORRECT RESULTS
Trying an array of size 1: [4]
the smallest value = 4
    Passed test
sum method1 = 4
sum method2 = 4
sum method3 = 4
sum method4 = 4
    Passed test

Trying an array of size 2, the same elements: [2, 2]
the smallest value = 2
    Passed test
sum method1 = 4
sum method2 = 4
sum method3 = 4
sum method4 = 4
    Passed test

Trying an array of size 2, second is smallest: [3, 2]
the smallest value = 2
    Passed test
sum method1 = 5
sum method2 = 5
sum method3 = 5
sum method4 = 5
    Passed test

Trying an array of size 2, first is smallest: [3, 4]
the smallest value = 3
    Passed test
sum method1 = 7
sum method2 = 7
sum method3 = 7
sum method4 = 7
    Passed test

Trying an array of size 3, first is smallest: [3, 10, 4]
the smallest value = 3
    Passed test
sum method1 = 17
sum method2 = 17
sum method3 = 17
sum method4 = 17
    Passed test

Trying an array of size 3, second is smallest: [10, 4, 13]
the smallest value = 4
    Passed test
sum method1 = 27
sum method2 = 27
sum method3 = 27
sum method4 = 27
    Passed test

Trying an array of size 3, third is smallest: [10, 13, 4]
the smallest value = 4
    Passed test
sum method1 = 27
sum method2 = 27
sum method3 = 27
sum method4 = 27
    Passed test

Trying an array of size 20: [10, 113, 25, 10, 35, 14, 29, 13, 14, 110, 13, 17, 34, 83, 9, 32, 44, 12, 90, 2]
--> Looking at all values - at indexes 0 ... 19
the smallest value = 2
    Passed test
sum method1 = 709
sum method2 = 709
sum method3 = 709
sum method4 = 709
    Passed test
--> Looking at first third - at indexes 0 ... 6
the smallest value = 10
    Passed test
sum method1 = 236
sum method2 = 236
sum method3 = 236
sum method4 = 236
    Passed test
--> Looking at second third - at indexes 7 ... 13
the smallest value = 13
    Passed test
sum method1 = 284
sum method2 = 284
sum method3 = 284
sum method4 = 284
    Passed test
--> Looking at last third excluding the last value - at indexes 13 ... 18
the smallest value = 9
    Passed test
sum method1 = 270
sum method2 = 270
sum method3 = 270
sum method4 = 270
    Passed test
