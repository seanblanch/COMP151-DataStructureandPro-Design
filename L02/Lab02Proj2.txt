Lab 02 Proj 2 Sample run

-> Creating aSet with the secondary constructor - capacity of 8
--> Adding elements from inputData to aSet
The set contains 4 String(s); capacity is 8
A B C D 

--> Clearing aSet
The set is empty; with the capacity 8
--> aSet isEmpty returns 
true
--> The number of elements in aSet is 
0

--> Creating set1 with default constructor
--> set1 initially empty, capacity should be 3:
The set is empty; with the capacity 3

--> Adding elements to set1
--> set1 after adding elements, capacity should be 3:
The set contains 3 String(s); capacity is 3
A B C 

--> Adding elements to set1

--> set1 after adding more elements which should have triggered resizing, and the capacity should be 12:
The set contains 10 String(s); capacity is 12
A B C V T U W X Y Z 

--> set1 contains "A":
true
--> set1 contains "E":
false

--> Removing "B" from set1
--> After removing "B" from set1:
The set contains 9 String(s); capacity is 12
A Z C V T U W X Y 
--> Removing random element from set1
--> After removing "Y" from set1:
The set contains 8 String(s); capacity is 12
A Z C V T U W X 

--> Trying to remove "Q" from set1
--> After trying to remove non-existent element "Q" from set1:
The set contains 8 String(s); capacity is 12
A Z C V T U W X 

--> Adding 4 elements to set1
--> After adding 4 elements to set1:
The set contains 12 String(s); capacity is 12
A Z C V T U W X K L M N 
--> Adding 1 element to set1
--> After adding 1 more element to set1:
The set contains 13 String(s); capacity is 24
A Z C V T U W X K L M N O 

--> Creating set2 with the secondary constructor that takes an array as input
The set contains 4 String(s); capacity is 8
A B C D 
--> Adding more elements to set2
--> set2 after adding:
The set contains 8 String(s); capacity is 8
A B C D E F G H 

Trying to add null entry
--> set2 after adding:
The set contains 8 String(s); capacity is 8
A B C D E F G H 

Process finished with exit code 0
