-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing the undirected, weighted graph.
Graph has 9 vertices and 13 edges.

Edges exist from the first vertex in each line to the other vertices in the line.
(Edge weights are given; weights are zero for unweighted graphs):

A -> B 2.0 D 5.0 E 4.0 
B -> A 2.0 E 1.0 C 3.0 
C -> B 3.0 F 4.0 
D -> A 5.0 G 2.0 
E -> A 4.0 B 1.0 F 3.0 H 6.0 
F -> E 3.0 C 4.0 H 3.0 I 1.0 
G -> D 2.0 H 1.0 
H -> E 6.0 F 3.0 G 1.0 I 1.0 
I -> H 1.0 F 1.0 

Number of vertices = 9 (should be 9)
Number of edges = 13 (should be 13)
Edges are OK.


Breadth-First Traversal beginning at vertex A: 
A B D E C G F H I  <-- Calculated
A B D E C G F H I  <-- Expected


Depth-First Traversal beginning at vertex A: 
A B E F C H G D I  <-- Calculated
A B E F C H G D I  <-- Expected


Finding the cheapest path in the graph in Figure 28-18a:

The cheapest path from A to B is 
A B 
and has a cost of 2.0.

The cheapest path from A to C is 
A B C 
and has a cost of 5.0.

The cheapest path from A to D is 
A D 
and has a cost of 5.0.

The cheapest path from A to E is 
A B E 
and has a cost of 3.0.

The cheapest path from A to F is 
A B E F 
and has a cost of 6.0.

The cheapest path from A to G is 
A D G 
and has a cost of 7.0.

The cheapest path from A to H is 
A D G H 
and has a cost of 8.0.

The cheapest path from A to I is 
A B E F I 
and has a cost of 7.0.
