-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing the directed, weighted graph in Figure 28-18a.
Graph has 9 vertices and 13 edges.

Edges exist from the first vertex in each line to the other vertices in the line.
(Edge weights are given; weights are zero for unweighted graphs):

A -> B 2.0 D 5.0 E 4.0 
B -> E 1.0 
C -> B 3.0 
D -> G 2.0 
E -> F 3.0 H 6.0 
F -> C 4.0 H 3.0 
G -> H 1.0 
H -> I 1.0 
I -> F 1.0 

Number of vertices = 9 (should be 9)
Number of edges = 13 (should be 13)
Edges are OK.


Breadth-First Traversal beginning at vertex A: 
A B D E G F H C I  <-- Calculated
A B D E G F H C I  <-- Expected


Depth-First Traversal beginning at vertex A: 
A B E F C H I D G  <-- Calculated
A B E F C H I D G  <-- Expected


Finding the cheapest path in the graph in Figure 28-18a:

The cheapest path from A to B is 
A B 
and has a cost of 2.0.

The cheapest path from A to C is 
A B E F C 
and has a cost of 10.0.

The cheapest path from A to D is 
A D 
and has a cost of 5.0.

The cheapest path from A to E is 
A B E 
and has a cost of 3.0.

The cheapest path from A to F is 
A B E F 
and has a cost of 6.0.

The cheapest path from A to G is 
A D G 
and has a cost of 7.0.

The cheapest path from A to H is 
A D G H 
and has a cost of 8.0.

The cheapest path from A to I is 
A D G H I 
and has a cost of 9.0.
