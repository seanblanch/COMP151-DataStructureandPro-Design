RUNNING TEST CASES

***Testing display method***
emptyBag:
The bag is empty.

bag1:
B C A B A 
There are 5 element(s) in the bag.

bag2:
The bag is empty.

After removing the first element "B" from bag1, it contains
C A B A 
There are 4 element(s) in the bag.

***Testing equals method***
bag1:
C A B A 
There are 4 element(s) in the bag.
Are bag1 and emptyBag equal? --> NO
Are emptyBag and emptyBag equal? --> YES
Are emptyBag and bag1 equal? --> NO

bag2:
X B A C A 
There are 5 element(s) in the bag.
Are bag1 and bag2 equal? --> NO

Removed "X" from bag2.
B A C A 
There are 4 element(s) in the bag.
Are bag1 and bag2 equal now? --> YES

Created bagCopyOfBag1:
C A B A 
There are 4 element(s) in the bag.
Are bag1 and bagCopyOfBag1 equal? --> YES

Created bagCopyOfBag1PlusOne:
C A B A D 
There are 5 element(s) in the bag.
Are bagCopyOfBag1PlusOne and bagCopyOfBag1 equal? --> NO
Are bagCopyOfBag1 and bagCopyOfBag1PlusOne equal? --> NO

***Testing getMax method***
The largest item in emptyBag is: null

bag1: 
A C A X B A A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.
The largest item in bag1 is: X

bag2: 
D C C A B B A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.
The largest item in bag2 is: D

***Testing union, removeMin, intersection, difference and subset methods***
bag1: 
A C A X B A A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.
bag2: 
D C C A B B A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.

***Testing union method***
The union of bag1 and bag2 is 
A B B A C C D A A B X A C A 
There are 14 element(s) in the bag.

The union of bag1 and emptyBag is 
A A B X A C A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.

The union of emptyBag and bag1 is 
A A B X A C A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.

***Testing removeMin method***
Removed the smallest element "A" from the union bag; the current content is:
A B X A C A 
There are 6 element(s) in the bag.
Removed the smallest element "A" from the union bag; the current content is:
B X A C A 
There are 5 element(s) in the bag.
Removed the smallest element "A" from the union bag; the current content is:
X B C A 
There are 4 element(s) in the bag.
Removed the smallest element "A" from the union bag; the current content is:
B C X 
There are 3 element(s) in the bag.
Removed the smallest element "B" from the union bag; the current content is:
C X 
There are 2 element(s) in the bag.
Removed the smallest element "C" from the union bag; the current content is:
X 
There are 1 element(s) in the bag.
Removed the smallest element "X" from the union bag; the current content is:
The bag is empty.

The union bag is empty and removeMin returned null - CORRECT

***Testing intersection method***
The intersection of bag1 and bag2 is 
B A C A 
There are 4 element(s) in the bag.

The intersection of bag1 and emptyBag is 
The bag is empty.

The intersection of emptyBag and bag1 is 
The bag is empty.

***Testing difference method***
The difference of bag1 and bag2 is 
X A A 
There are 3 element(s) in the bag.

The difference of bag2 and bag1 is 
B C D 
There are 3 element(s) in the bag.

The difference of bag1 and emptyBag is 
A A B X A C A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.

The difference of emptyBag and bag1 is 
The bag is empty.

***Testing replace method***
Bag1 contains:
A C A X B A A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.
Replaced "A" with "X"
Now bag1 contains:
X C A X B A A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.

Calling replace on emptyBag
The bag is empty and replace returned null - CORRECT
Now emptyBag contains:
The bag is empty.

***Testing removeEvery method***
Bag1 contains:
X C A X B A A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.
Removing all "Z"
After removing all "Z" bag1 contains:
X C A X B A A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.

Removing all "X"
After removing all "X" bag1 contains:
A C B A A 
There are 5 element(s) in the bag.

After adding two "A" bag1 contains:
A A A C B A A 
There are 7 element(s) in the bag.
Removing all "A"
After removing all "A" bag1 contains:
C B 
There are 2 element(s) in the bag.

Removing all "B"
After removing all "B" bag1 contains:
C 
There are 1 element(s) in the bag.

After removing all "C" emptyBag contains:
The bag is empty.
